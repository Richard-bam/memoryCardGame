# Rules of the game

The game starts with all the cards face down and the player takes turns to turn over a card and check if it matches another card. If the two cards have the same picture, then the cards will remain facing up, otherwise they turn the cards face down again. You win if all the cards are face up before you run out of turns. You can restart at anytime with the restart button and the cards will be reshuffled.The difficulty settings are easy, medium and hard. These affect the amount of turns allowed as well as the amount of time you are allowed to look at your card before it is turned back over. The default difficulty is easy
